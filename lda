As planned, I will proceed with the code deployment to production on September 27th, ensuring the system is ready. However, I had a call today with Srivatsa, Prasanth, Nidhula, and Gopi, during which Gopi explained the process to be followed before placing the production CSV data on the server.

It has been communicated that before moving the production CSV data, the regular GBI data pipeline must be paused for that specific business date to avoid any conflicts. However, they have mentioned that the regular data process is dependent on other systems and cannot be stopped without prior notifications.

In light of this, it is recommended that we include everyone, including Joe Salerno and Debbie, in our next Nudges call to discuss the matter further.

Srivatsa, please feel free to include your input as well.
