I wanted to thank you for offering me the opportunity to join your team and for considering me for such an exciting role. It truly means a lot to have been approached by someone of your caliber.

After careful thought, I have decided to pursue a different path at this time. Please accept my sincerest apologies for not being able to join your team at this moment. This was not an easy decision, as I genuinely admire the work your team is doing and the leadership you bring to the table.

I hope to have the chance to collaborate with you in the future, and I would be thrilled if the opportunity to join your team arises again. Thank you once again for your understanding and for the confidence you placed in me.

Wishing you and your team continued success!
