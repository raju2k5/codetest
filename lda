As I mark one year at JPMorgan Chase, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your guidance and support throughout this journey. This past year has been incredibly rewarding, and I truly appreciate the opportunities I’ve had to grow and contribute under your leadership.

Your encouragement and constructive feedback have played a significant role in shaping my professional development, and I’m grateful for the trust and confidence you’ve shown in me.

Looking forward to continuing to learn and contribute as we work together toward our goals.

Thank you once again for everything!
